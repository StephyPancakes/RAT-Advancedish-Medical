**The ACE Advanced Medical System is nice, but we can do it better, even on a more realistic way and bring it on another level with these addons.**

Originaly created by Katalam, KAT is currently maintained by Tomcat, Kygan, YetheSamartaka, Battlekeeper, MJSTIC, MiszczuZPolski and Digii / Julian. RAT is created and maintained by RAT (StephyPancakes on GitHub). Thanks to DMZ for current logo.
